      <p>
        The point of this website is to do an automated check of your BOTC script (using the JSON
        files created by the
        <a href="https://script.bloodontheclocktower.com" target="_blank">Script Tool</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        This will allow you to avoid basic mistakes while making scripts, or at least warn you of
        potential issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warnings given by this tool are not perfect nor are they a reason to rework your script:
        they are just interactions you might need to think about in order to smooth out the edges of
        your script, but it isn't required for every one of them to be fully resolved.
